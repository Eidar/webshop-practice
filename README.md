# webshop-practice
This is the practice code for dummy webshop that I'm trying to do. It is mainly used to figure out how all this works, and what problems you can run into when coding such framework.


For the moment the only thing there is, is some basic functionality. I'm trying to figure out sessions, connection to mysql database, and how to make an automatic "installation". In other words, how to make scripted setup of mysql connection, database and table setup needed for this framework. Idea is to make it simple and easy to use.
